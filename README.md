# 3D-patches-classifier
In this study we develop an artificial intelligence (AI) framework to deliver a 3D anatomical lung model with the patient's disease profile and the uncertainty estimation of the diagnosis. We study a multi-classification problem of pulmonary hypertension diseases using different deep learning models. We estimate the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty of the framework and datasets, and we used generalised explainable and feature engineering techniques (PCA, GradCam) to study and validate the classification predictions of the deep learning network. The AI framework was evaluated in an unbiased validation scheme (internal / unseen datasets) delivered accurate, robust and generalised results of 82.18 \% Dice score, 14.85 mm Hamming distances and 0.746 Root Mean Square Error in the unseen out of distribution dataset.
